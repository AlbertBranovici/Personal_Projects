# Personal_Projects
I've uploaded a project I made for Uni.
This is an Insurance application writtne in Java, implementing multiple classes and file readers. Contracts created in this application are saved in the Contracts folder. For each contract created, the file contractsDataBase is updated with new lines containing details from the contract.

CNP is like a social security code but for Romania. Here are some CNP codes that are correct:
  - 5020430199189
  - 5040213098099
  - 5030807899098

  First number 5-male, 1-female
  second two numbers are the last digits of the year of birth ex: 2002 will be 02
  the next two numbers are the month of birth ex: april will be 04
  the next two numbers are the day of birth ex: 02,11,14,etc
  the next 6 numbers will be random
  
  --I'm including these so you can enter whatever CNP you want for the client. I also implemented a class CNPValidator which 
  verifies if the CNP is correct--
